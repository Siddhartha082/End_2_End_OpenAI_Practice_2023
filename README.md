# OpenAI Python Library


The OpenAI Python library provides convenient access to the OpenAI API from applications written in the Python language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses which makes it compatible with a wide range of versions of the OpenAI API.

You can find usage examples for the OpenAI Python library in our API reference and the OpenAI Cookbook.
